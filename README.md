- 👋 Hi, I’m Ivan!
- 👀 I have a strong interest in C#, .NET, ASP.NET, design patterns, Web API, WPF, and other exciting technologies.
- 🌱 I’m continuously expanding my knowledge in these areas and always eager to learn more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on .NET projects, cloud solutions, machine learning, and beyond.
- 📫 Want to get in touch? Follow the white rabbit! Just kidding 😄. You can find me on X (formerly Twitter) @izanolla or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanzanolla/)
